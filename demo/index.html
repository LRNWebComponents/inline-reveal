          <p slot="content">The mighty<a data-trigger>Great White shark</a>(Carcharodon carcharias) is often mistakenly 
            thought of as the most voracious predator of the seas, and even has a reputation as a ferocious man-eater, something 
            that sadly has been hugely exaggerated by the media. Their powerful body is supported by a cartilaginous skeleton 
            (as opposed to the bone skeleton of most other vertebrates), is streamlined for efficient movement through the water, 
            and has a pointed snout, two large, sickle-shaped pectoral fins and a large triangular first dorsal fin.
            The mouth is armed with an array of sharply pointed, serrated teeth; indeed the generic name is derived from the Greek 
            word carcharos for ragged and odon for tooth. These sharks are grey or bronze on the upper surface of the body and are 
            white underneath (5). They have an acute sense of smell and are able to sense electric fields through sensors in the snout.
